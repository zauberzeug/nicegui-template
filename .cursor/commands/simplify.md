description: Suggest ways to simplify the current code or template
---

Review the current code or template and suggest simplifications.

Look for:

- Unnecessary complexity in Jinja2 templates
- Code duplication that could use variables or includes
- Over-complicated logic in Python code
- Opportunities to use standard patterns

Propose concrete, simpler alternatives.
