## pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a tool to help you manage and run pre-commit hooks in your code.
It is used to check your code for e.g. extra whitespace or formatting errors before committing it.
Install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

You can also run the hooks manually by running:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
{% endif %}
