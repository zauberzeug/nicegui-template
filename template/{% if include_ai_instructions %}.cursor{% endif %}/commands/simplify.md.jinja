description: Suggest ways to simplify the current code
---

Ensure you understand the project by reading README.md and AGENT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
and then review the current code and suggest simplifications.

Look for:
- Unnecessary complexity
- Code duplication
- Over-abstraction
- Opportunities to use standard patterns

Propose concrete, simpler alternatives which adhere to the principles in AGENT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
